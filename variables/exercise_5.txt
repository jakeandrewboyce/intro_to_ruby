In the first case, x will print 3. This is because x is a variable defined
outside of the scope of the block that follows the 'times' method.

In the second case, printing x will give an error. That is because x is a
local variable within the block that follows 'times'. It cannot be accessed
outside of the block when we try to 'puts x'.
